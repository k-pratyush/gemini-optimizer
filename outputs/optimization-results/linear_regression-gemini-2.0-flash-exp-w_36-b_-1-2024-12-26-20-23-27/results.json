We have seen improvement between b=27 and b=25, while slightly smaller gains going lower towards 20. Given that the pairs are provided in descending order based on their function values, the minimum should be around that neighborhood of w = 35 and b close to the provided pairs. Let's try w=35 and b=25 and also w=35, b=24 because this point might give even better score. In fact the point with the lowest score has b = 0 and w = 36 and 100 score so it could still give improvements.  Let's check nearby point with w=36 and b = 1.  Or simply use b=0, and w=35. Let's try to go further with this direction and search values with b= -1 to b = -10 since values get lower and lower at b = 0. Trying values close to w = 35 or 36 could make sense.
