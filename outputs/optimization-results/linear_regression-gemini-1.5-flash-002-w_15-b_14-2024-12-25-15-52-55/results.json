This pattern appears to improve performance.\", \"weight_bias_pair\": [15,14]}",

The lowest values seem to cluster around w and b values in the range of 14-16.  Therefore, exploring values near this range and slightly below or at the low end is reasonable.  I'm choosing a point within this range that has not yet been tested in the hopes of finding an even lower function value. \", \"weight_bias_pair\": [15, 14]}",
