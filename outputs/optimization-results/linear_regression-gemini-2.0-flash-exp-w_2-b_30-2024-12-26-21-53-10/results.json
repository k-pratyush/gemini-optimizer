We need to find a new pair different from all above with a value smaller than 11082. Let's try w = 3 and b = 4.8. since this is not an integer, let us move to the left and then the right so we keep them integers; (3,4) or (3,5) already in the input. Since the function appears to decrease further and then increase in b, and we are on the increase from (3,4) to (3,5) then let's test with slightly lower 'b' but different from what we have; or lets try w=3.5, not possible, let's try decreasing w or increasing. if w decreases, say to 2, at b around 6 or 7 its above 20,000. Lets consider if w increase, if we take w=4 from above, function value is well above. Considering above pattern. Let us now consider w=3, and try to decrease or increase the bias a little bit; and if we cannot improve, then we could try the integer values around w=3 such as w=2, w=4. Since we have (3,4) as 11096 and (3,5) as 11082, if we go the same direction we could check (3,6). Since function values seem to reduce when we are in between (3,-8) and (3,12). Lets explore around 3 by going either side in terms of w and since our goal is to go as low as possible from 11082, let's look for (w=2, b =6) which is 29201 and (w=4, b= -3) = 58861 which is again well above the minimal found so far with (3,5). So, going towards negative side, then say (w=3,b=5) gave us 11082; now let us see for value near it; it is at w=3. we have checked all values at w=3 around b=5. Then lets change both w,b. w=2 leads us far above. Thus lets try increasing w by one each time starting at the lowest i.e (w=3).Let's keep w=3, then b=6 (11168), 7 (11354), etc... Thus w should be greater than 3, so w=3, b = 5 already gives us a smaller number. Let's investigate, w= 4 is bad, lets look for w=3; lets choose b between 4 and 5.  Lets investigate negative side. lets check w=3 and b=-7; (3,-8), 19064. Since b= -3;13994. Then go near 0 from -3 gives 13280.  We explored a range of w =2, 3 and 4 and explored near the lowest point from the provided sample which was 11082. We now want a new value at w = 3 around b=5; since integers we can't go near it, then we consider integer values of w, such as 2 or 4 and see which one can go lower. Given above observations lets try w = 3 b= -4 which is 14776 and not less; then let's try w = 3, b=15; seems higher so, lets explore around 3 again b = 5 which gave 11082 and near that region b=4 gave 11096. Let's take a value close to the low and change w and b both at the same time say w = 3 +1 =4 and b=5+1=6 so it is at (4,6), which goes out of bound, so lets go towards the smaller range if increase is not helpful so let's reduce w=2 and see with different b; b=6 is 29201. Therefore we need something at around w =3. Therefore to reach less value we need to explore from 3,5. We need to modify both so let's reduce w to 2.5 (not integer). It looks like it is very sensitive around w so change b around 5 is still good choice. Let us try (w =3,b=5) which gave 11082. We want lower",
