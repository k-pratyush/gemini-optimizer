Thus exploring (w=0, b=1) or (w=1, b=0) as this seems to give lowest value based on trends so far. Comparing w=1,b=0 (value=731914), w=0,b=0 (value=2050067) and w=0,b=3 (value = 1972332). It seems that when either w or b is set to 0 we observe a function value around 2 million while setting them both to smaller values produces much smaller values and are better candidates. However it appears both are being pushed towards positive numbers that are close together. Given the prior value for w=2,b=3=73324 the next logical step would be (w=2,b=2)=78836 or (w=2,b=1) = 84548. Given w=3,b=3 gives 138871, and w=1,b=1 gives 715902 and all have worse results. Thus reducing both at the same time yields good results, So we predict a decrease in the value with w and b set to values smaller than those given. From given value (2,2)=78836,(2,1) =84548.  It seems that for a given w, moving b around results in not so much variation. It would seem setting w = 1, b= 0 as our smallest seen should provide even lower values, and we already saw that with value = 731914. Thus we explore values around this. Looking at previous, (w,b) combinations with lower w and b's (w=1 and b=2) = 700090, (w=1 and b=3)= 684478. This data seems to show that increasing 'b' while keeping 'w' same seems to reduce results. Thus to reduce it further, try moving towards 0 (as seen by the data for w=0,b=0) and let's choose values below 2 for both. Thus we choose the next one in the sequence as 1 for both or very small values below that like (w, b) = (1,0) which has a function value of 731914.\",\n  \"weight_bias_pair\": [\n    1,\n    0\n  ]\n}",

Now, given this direction and because b=5 with w=3 provided lowest values with similar function levels at w=1 we try out w=0 and see a slight increase again and decrease as well when moving toward w=-1, then b=2 or b=3 and check its value since we need b>= -1. It appears b value of 2 to 5 produces similar range of the values but are still larger than w=2. Let's check a smaller w such as w = 1. Using b values near the last low b value that corresponds to smallest function values, from 3 to 5 the lowest value occurs at w=3 and b =3 and b=4 and b=5, all in that 100-150 range and that corresponds with lowest values of w, starting at 1. Also at 2 for some value. At w=1 values range 650-750 for b=1 to b=5, while it looks w=2 ranges from 60 - 100 and at w=3 from 138-148, and values with w=0 have an opposite trend going 1900->2000 when increasing b. So we need w around the 1-3 range, and a higher value of b within the ranges for w and keeping value at lowest we can see with b range around 3 to 5 . w=3 produced lowest values but when b decreases it seems the values decreased but very small value range, b= 2 we can expect much higher values and b = -1 we go around 200000 when w is at 2, so lets select b within 4-5 and make sure it keeps following the trend. Trying w=4 with similar b values, and notice the function increased around the value of 900K when w = 4 at b=4 and b=5, which is bigger than all w range near the b range, and seems w=0 also yields similar high range and w=-1 yield even higher range. We see that 2 is slightly lower than values in the range of 0-1, so with all above and that at w=2 b is optimal around 5. Also, lets check if w=3 is better by checking between b=4 and b=5. Seems 4 and 5 are better for w=3, with 140 and 150 values compared to range of 60-100 for w=2 when changing b around 5. w=2 had a slightly lower value so checking for w = 2 and decreasing b to 4, and we see we got the value around 68K.

Lets keep b at 5 and try w value in-between, 2 to 3. Trying w =2.5 rounding gives w=3 and if we consider b=4 we obtain a much lower number.
